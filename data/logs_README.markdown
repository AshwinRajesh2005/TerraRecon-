# TerraRecon Logs Directory

This directory (`data/logs/`) stores debug and operational logs generated by the TerraRecon rover during runtime.

## Purpose
- Logs capture events such as:
  - Motor control actions (e.g., "Moving forward", "Obstacle detected").
  - Vision processing results (e.g., person detection, face recognition).
  - Communication status (e.g., alert sending success/failure).
  - Errors and warnings (e.g., GPIO or camera issues).

## Usage
- Logs are generated by scripts in `src/` (e.g., `main.py`, `vision_processing.py`).
- Example log entry:
  ```
  [2025-08-06 18:07:23] INFO: Moving forward
  [2025-08-06 18:07:24] WARNING: Obstacle DETECTED at 25.3 cm
  ```
- To enable logging, ensure the `data/logs/` directory exists:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/logs
  ```

## Notes
- Log files are not included in the Git repository (see `.gitignore`).
- Configure logging in `src/main.py` or other modules to write to specific files (e.g., `data/logs/rover.log`).
- Regularly clear old logs to manage disk space.
