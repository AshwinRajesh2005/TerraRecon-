# Placeholder for database.sqlite
# This file is a binary SQLite database storing face encodings for the TerraRecon project.
# It is generated by `scripts/setup_database.py` and populated by `scripts/enroll_faces.py`.

# Instructions to create this file:
1. Run the database setup script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_database.py
   ```
   - This creates `data/database.sqlite` with a `registered_personnel` table.
2. Enroll faces to populate the database:
   ```bash
   python scripts/enroll_faces.py
   ```
   - Place face images in `data/faces/` (e.g., `john_doe.jpg`).
3. The database schema includes:
   - `id`: Integer primary key (auto-incremented).
   - `name`: Text (personâ€™s name, e.g., "JohnDoe").
   - `face_encoding`: BLOB (128D face encoding from `face_recognition`).
   - `image_filename`: Text (original image filename).

# Notes:
- Do not manually edit this file; use `scripts/enroll_faces.py` to add entries.
- Ensure `data/` directory exists before running scripts.
- The database is referenced in `src/config.py` as `DATABASE_PATH`.
