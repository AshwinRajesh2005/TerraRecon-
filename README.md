# TerraRecon 
TerraRecon is an autonomous military surveillance rover designed to enhance defense and security operations through advanced AI and RF technology. Developed as a Bachelor of Technology project by students at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram, TerraRecon integrates a Raspberry Pi 4 as its central processing unit, coupled with LIDAR, infrared cameras, and GPS for real-time environment mapping, threat detection, and autonomous navigation. The rover features a modular, terrain-adaptive chassis with 3D-printed tracks, enabling it to navigate diverse and challenging environments. Its software architecture, built on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python, supports real-time object detection using YOLO and facial recognition, alongside secure RF communication for long-range data transmission. TerraRecon aims to reduce manual surveillance risks, improve operational efficiency, and provide scalable solutions for military applications, such as border security and autonomous patrolling. The project demonstrates significant potential for transforming defense operations with its robust, customizable, and energy-efficient design.
