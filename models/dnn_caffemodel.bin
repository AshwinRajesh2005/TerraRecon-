# Placeholder for dnn_caffemodel.caffemodel
# This file should contain the trained weights for the Caffe model defined in dnn_prototxt.txt.
# The actual .caffemodel file is not provided in the project document.

# Instructions to obtain this file:
# 1. Download the pre-trained weights corresponding to the .prototxt file (e.g., MobileNet-SSD or YOLO).
#    - Example source: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/master/testdata/dnn
#    - Common file: `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel`
# 2. Rename the downloaded .caffemodel file to `dnn_caffemodel.caffemodel` and place it in the `models/` directory.
# 3. Ensure it matches the architecture defined in `dnn_prototxt.txt`.
# 4. Update `src/config.py` if the filename differs.

# Note: This is a binary file and cannot be edited directly. Replace this placeholder with the actual .caffemodel file for the model used in TerraRecon.
